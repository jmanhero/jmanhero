- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason @jmanhero
- 👀 I’m interested in all things embedded. I've done it all from smps design and modeling, back end Java dev, to voice interfaces on Arm M7 based Mcus and custom Yocto builds. Outside of programming I spend 100% of my time in the mountains of the PNW or in my garage doing some kind of home project.  
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a deep dive on the Yocto project and creating my own meta-layers and recipes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... home automation and gizmos projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... jason@mountaintop-designs.com
